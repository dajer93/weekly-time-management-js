This is a small application which helps me planning my weeks.

## Weekly time management

The basic idea is an application similar to a trello board. It has 7 columns (days), each column consists of 24 hours. You can assign cards to each day, and each card has an attribute of estimated time it takes. For instance, you would add these cards for the monday column: work (8.5 hours), commuting (1.5 hours), workout (3 hours), sleep (8 hours), cook & eat dinner (1 hour), freetime (2 hours).

### Todo: 
- Change item hour estimation
- Change item title
- Add item to day
- Remove item from day
- Activity pool
- Add item to activity pool
- Remove item from activity pool
- Drag&drop cloning items from activity pool
- Styling

### Scripts 
Borrowed from the create-react-app default readme: 
#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
